#Dm0nk's Tcalc 
===================

Tcalc is a CLI application, that will run on Windows and Linux (not testet on mac yet).

Tcalc is made because I think its nice to be able to tell a customer how long time a backup will take, like in this usecase:

You have sold backup to a customer, and you know the customer wants to take a backup of 100GB data. and you know the customer have an 20Mbit Upload connection. And you also know that the customer shutdown the computers everyday at 5PM. And by Calculating the time it will take with Tcalc to preform the initial backup you can tell the customer not to shutdown down the computer that is currently backing up becasue it will take 11Hours and 39Minutes given the fact that the computer is allowed to use all the bandwith for the backup

###RequireMents
The application is only using the standard liberys in cpp so there is no requirements for extra liberys.
