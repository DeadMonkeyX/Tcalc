{"name":"Tcalc","tagline":"Tclac calculates transfer speed from the size in GB and the speed in mbit","body":"### Welcome to the Tcalc Project page\r\n***\r\nTcalc is a small CLI application written in cpp and it does what the name says \"Transfer Calculator\" it will calculate the transfer speed from the given Mbit connection and the filesize in GB.\r\n\r\nIt has been testet on Windows 7 and Debian 7 - compiled from the source and it works perfectly !\r\n\r\nTcalc is made because I think its nice to be able to tell a customer how long time a backup will take, like in this usecase:\r\n\r\nYou have sold backup to a customer, and you know the customer wants to take a backup of 100GB data. and you know the customer have an 20Mbit Upload connection. And you also know that the customer shutdown the computers everyday at 5PM. And by Calculating the time it will take with Tcalc to preform the initial backup you can tell the customer not to shutdown down the computer that is currently backing up becasue it will take 11Hours and 39Minutes given the fact that the computer is allowed to use all the bandwith for the backup\r\n\r\n#### _**There is no requirements**_ for this application except a cpp compiler so you can compile the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### If you are Lazy? and trust me ? you can now download a compiled version of Tcalc for windows [Here](https://github.com/dM0nk/Tcalc/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-45934053-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
